# Red-Line Project

The Red line project / bad website transformation.

## description

This project was one of our first individual project where we needed to put what we learned to the test, 

We all got the task to look for a bad website that needed a make over badly.

The website that I was given was: www.grondwerkendesaegher.be They are a landscaping company located in Sint-Niklaas Belgium. 

After consulting with the "client: Coach" I came up with a mockup for the transformation of the website.
The end result came out like this: https://oliviervdh.github.io/Red-Line-bad-website-transformation/. 

## technologies

The technologies used for this project are HTML, CSS and some basic Javascript.
