Hello Dear readers. 

This is the readme for our first individual project: "The Red Line project"

We got the task to look for bad website that needed a make over badly.

The website that I was given is :www.grondwerkendesaegher.be, they are a landscaping company located in Sint-Niklaas Belgium. 

After consulting with the client we came up with a mockup for the transformation of the website,
the end result came out like this: https://ollivdh.github.io/Red-Line/. 

Thanks for reading! 

Peace out, Olli.
